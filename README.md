pykanren
========

an attempt to implement miniKanren in Python

Currently working through chapter 3 of William Byrd's PhD thesis[1],
occasionally checking stuff in Clojure's core.logic[2]
and miniKanren itself[3,4]. Also helpful was Ambrose Bonnaire-Sergeant's
talk "Introduction to Logic Programming with Clojure"[5]
