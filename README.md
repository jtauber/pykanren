pykanren
========

an attempt to implement miniKanren in Python

Currently working through the original miniKanren[1] and *The Reasoned
Schemer*, occasionally checking stuff in chapter 3 of William Byrd's PhD thesis[2],
Clojure's core.logic[3] and newer miniKanren[4]. Also helpful was Ambrose
Bonnaire-Sergeant's talk "Introduction to Logic Programming with Clojure"[5].
